My first game on Python called  "Break your space" :).
In this game you need jump over the bats. Also, if you press 'F': you can throw shurikens at them (quantity of shurikens limited (10) ).
if you lose (although it's hardly possible, because the game very easy) you will see lose screen and you can try again
